## EACH EXERCISE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE APP

### Exercise 1
Exercise 3
Create a House model with address, bedrooms, bathrooms, and squareFeet attributes. Create 3 entries using 3 different methods (admin site, create method using an endpoint, and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all addresses, create a new endpoint that only prints entries with more than 2 bedrooms, and create another new endpoint to change the squareFeet attribute to 9999 if an entry has more than 5 bathrooms.

### Exercise 2
Exercise 2
Create a Car model with make, model, and year attributes. Create 2 entries using 2 different methods (admin site and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all entry years, create a new endpoint that only prints entries with years greater than 2010. Create another new endpoint to change the models of all entries with year greater than 2010 to be "F150".
